        <h3>Amsterdam</h3>

        <div class="box">
          <p>
            Amsterdam is the Netherlands’ capital, known for its artistic heritage, elaborate canal system and narrow
            houses with
            gabled facades, legacies of the city’s 17th-century Golden Age. Its Museum District houses the Van Gogh
            Museum, works by
            Rembrandt and Vermeer at the Rijksmuseum, and modern art at the Stedelijk. Cycling is key to the city’s
            character, and
            there are numerous bike paths.
          </p>

          <p>
            Amsterdam is famous for its canals, beautiful houses, ‘coffee’ shops and Red Light District, but there’s
            plenty more to
            this liberal city than most visitors realise
          </p>

        <h3>Hong Kong</h3>

        <div class="box">
          <p>
            Hong Kong, officially the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, is a
            metropolitan
            area and special administrative region of the People's Republic of China in the eastern Pearl River Delta by
            the South
            China Sea.
          </p>

          <p>
            Futuristic skyscrapers set against a shimmering harbor; the chimes from double decker trams zipping through
            traffic; the
            smell of roast geese hanging by shop windows: Hong Kong makes a first impression like no other place on
            Earth.
            The
            business and financial hub proudly flaunts—and deserves—the title of “Asia’s World City.” The former British
            Crown
            Colony is prime for an urban adventure; from the neon-lit streets of Mongkok to the humble fishing villages
            in
            Tai O,
            you will never run out of sights to discover, and T+L’s Hong Kong travel guide will take you to the best of
            them.

        <h3>Paris</h3>
        <div class="box">
          <p>Paris, France's capital, is a major European city and a global center for art, fashion, gastronomy and
            culture. Its
            19th-century cityscape is crisscrossed by wide boulevards and the River Seine. Beyond such landmarks as the
            Eiffel
            Tower
            and the 12th-century, Gothic Notre-Dame cathedral, the city is known for its cafe culture and designer
            boutiques
            along
            the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré.</p>
          <p>
            There’s a reason Paris is one of the most popular cities among travelers. Known as the “City of Light” or
            the
            “City
            of
            Love,” the streets of Paris overflow with culture, art, beauty, and history. Whether searching out Monet’s
            Water
            Lilies
            at Musée de l’Orangerie, climbing the many steps of Sacré-Cœur, standing before the Eiffel Tower in awe, or
            searching
            out the best crepes along the Seine, Paris is a city that captures the hearts of millions ever year.

        <h3>Seoul</h3>

        <div class="box">
          <p>
            ONE GLIMPSE OF SEOUL AND YOU’LL KNOW WHY IT’S TRENDING. There is no city in the world more adept at finding
            a
            fad and,
            with mind-boggling speed, blowing it up and putting it on every street corner and back alley. If you see it
            in
            Brooklyn
            today and it’s even remotely cool, you’ll likely see it in Seoul tomorrow.
          </p>

          <p>
            World-class dining? Check. Museums and galleries? Check. A nightlife that never stops? I mean, we did rank
            Seoul the
            number one party city in the world, so. South Korea’s capital is a whirlwind of action, a high-energy hub of
            10 million
            residents who fully embrace the work hard, play hard mentality. And since South Korea is small, with Seoul a
            mere
            four-hour train ride from even the farthest-flung city, it’s easy to go full vacation mode and explore the
            country at
            large. Allot enough time. I recommend at least a week, so you can really “do” Seoul and also take a day trip
            or two.

        <h3>Vancouver</h3>

        <div class="box">
          <p>
            Vancouver is dazzling. It’s generously endowed with natural splendor -- snow capped mountains! Temperate
            rainforests!
            The ocean! -- but it’s also a vibrant city with a glassy downtown and dozens of unique neighborhoods to
            explore.
          </p>

          <p>
            Vancouver might be Canada’s third biggest city, but you’ve got to get out of the urban center and into
            nature.
            It’s on
            the ocean, is replete with parks and beaches, and there are mountains nearby for hiking in summer and skiing
            in winter.
            All in all, there’s an overwhelming number of outdoor activities to enjoy, including but not limited to
            sailing, whale
            watching, salmon fishing, ziplining, kayaking, swimming, paddle boarding, and biking.
