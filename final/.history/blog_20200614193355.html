      <h1>An estimated 17.6 billion pounds of plastic leaks into the marine environment from land-based sources every
        year. This is
        roughly equivalent to dumping a garbage truck full of plastic into the oceans every minute. </h1>

      <p class="">Our movement to combat plastic pollution is growing at an unprecedented rate, you can join
        us to make a
        difference and
        accelerate this vital momentum. If you would like to help make a change locally and globally to help remove our
        ocean of
        plastic pollution, now is the time.</p>

          All plastic is having harmful impacts on marine and non-marine life. A recent report from the Convention on
          Biological
          Diversity found that between 2012 and 2016, the number of species documented to have been affected by marine
          debris, of
          which plastic is the predominant source, has risen to 817. The primary impacts are from ingestion,
          entanglement, and
          habitat damage or destruction. Seas hold as many as 51trn microplastic particles. Some are the product of
          larger pieces
          breaking apart; others, like microbeads added to toothpaste or face scrubs, were designed to be tiny. The
          cumulative
          amount of solid plastic waste produced since the 1950s that has not been burned or recycled is around 4.9bn
          tonnes. It
          could all have been dumped in a landfill 70 meters deep and 57 square kilometres in areaâ€”that is to say, the
          size of
          Manhattan.
        </p>

        <p>Endangered Species International (ESI) has been tackling plastic pollution head on for over a decade. For
          last three
          years alone, we have removed an average of 500 pounds of plastics per day from the ocean, raised awareness
          about the
          danger of plastic pollution to over 20,000 coastal communities, and supported aggressive ban of single-use
          plastics and
          implementation of recycling of plastics.</p>
