        Endangered Species International is strongly committed to reversing the trend of human-induced species
        extinction,
        saving endangered animals, and preserving wild places.

      </p>

      <p>Plants and animals are part of our unique heritage, they keep us alive, purifying water, fixing nitrogen,
        recycling
        nutrients and waste, and pollinating crops. They are vital for the physical and spiritual well-being offering us
        a
        colorful and rich world.</p>



      <p class="p-headline">
        More than 31,000 species are threatened with extinction. That is 27% of all assessed species.
      </p>

      <p>We focus on species that have the biggest chance to become extinct including those that do not attract the
        media
        attention. Their ecosystems as a whole are a crucial component of our conservation strategy. We also work hard
        on
        saving
        endangered species found in various types of habitat and serving as protecting umbrella to other endangered
        species.

            <p>One of the world’s most endangered mammals.They are particularly susceptible
              to being caught as bycatch in the snares set by poachers. If one dog gets
              caught in a snare, the rest of the pack are most likely to go back to find the missing individual. An
              entire
