      <!-- Blog Post 1 Platic in Ocean -->
      <div class="blogpost1">

        <div class="blog-heroimage1 blog-image"></div>

        <h1>An estimated 17.6 billion pounds of plastic leaks into the marine environment from land-based sources ever
          year. This is roughly equivalent to dumping a garbage truck full of plastic into the oceans every minute!
        </h1>


        <p class="">Our movement to combat plastic pollution is growing at an unprecedented rate, you can join
          us to make a
          difference and
          accelerate this vital momentum. If you would like to help make a change locally and globally to help remove
          our
          ocean of
          plastic pollution, now is the time.</p>




        <div class="toggle-content">
          <p class="">
            All plastic is having harmful impacts on marine and non-marine life. A recent report from the Convention on
            Biological Diversity found that between 2012 and 2016, the number of species documented to have been
            affected
            by marine debris, of which plastic is the predominant source, has risen to 817. The primary impacts are from
            ingestion,entanglement, and habitat damage or destruction. Seas hold as many as 51trn microplastic
            particles.
            Some are the product of larger pieces
            breaking apart; others, like microbeads added to toothpaste or face scrubs, were designed to be tiny. The
            cumulative amount of solid plastic waste produced since the 1950s that has not been burned or recycled is
            around 4.9bn tonnes. It could all have been dumped in a landfill 70 meters deep and 57 square kilometres in
            areaâ€”that is to say, the size of Manhattan.
          </p>

          <p>Endangered Species International (ESI) has been tackling plastic pollution head on for over a decade. For
            last three years alone, we have removed an average of 500 pounds of plastics per day from the ocean, raised
            awareness about the danger of plastic pollution to over 20,000 coastal communities, and supported aggressive
            ban of single-use plastics and
            implementation of recycling of plastics.</p>

      <!-- BLOG POST 2! Stop Illegal Wildlife Trading-->

      <!-- <img class="blog-heroimage2 blog-image" src="images/illegaltrade.jpg" alt="Illegal Anmial Trading"> -->
      <div class="blog-heroimage2 blog-image"></div>

      <h1>Stop Illegal Wildlife Trading! </h1>

      <p class="">Illegal selling of endangered species is thriving at local markets, stores, and on the internet around
        the
        world! Over
        the last two years, Endangered Species International documented an outstanding number of endangered species
        sold
        illegally in Africa and Asia. In many cases, live animals are kept in poor conditions under immense stress.
        Threatened
        animals for sale include many species of mammals, amphibians, reptiles, birds, insects, fishes, and corals.
        Prices vary
        from species to species, but can be bought at a very low price at local markets.
      </p>




      <div class="toggle-content2">

        <p>For example in Asia, a juvenile endangered green sea turtle is sold as a pet for 50 U.S. dollars; in Africa,
          the hand of
          an endangered western gorilla is sold for 6 dollars; and in south America, a rare endemic butterfly is sold
          for 3
          dollars. Despite international laws, animal body parts of protected species are traded around the world. For
          examples,
          body parts of hawksbill turtle shells, shahtoosh shawls from the Tibetan antelope, and furs from rare otters
          in south
          east Asia are found in both black and open markets. Of the estimated 350 million animals and plants being
          traded
          worldwide every year, it is believed that 25% is carried out illegally!
        </p>

        <p>
          Increased use of traditional medicine has also spread drastically the trade of rare species. For example, the
          Asian
          pangolin populations are rapidly declining due to poaching for use in traditional Chinese medicine. The
          illegal animal
          trade favors political corruption, transnational crime, including narcotics and trade in armaments.</p>
        <p>
          With your support, Endangered Species International works in many fronts to save endangered species from the
          illegal
          trade and let them live freely in their environment. We conduct patrols in remote areas (anti-poaching effort)
          where
          endangered species are illegally captured, increase awareness, find livelihood alternatives, and provide
          stronger
          enforcement tools!</p>
        <p>
          Join Endangered Species International to ban illegal trade of endangered animals and plants! They are not for
          sale! </p>

      <!-- BLOG POST 3! Rainforest-->

      <div class="blog-heroimage3 blog-image"></div>


      <h1>The Amazon Rainforest Crisis</h1>

      <p class="">Fires in the Amazon are often set on purpose to clearland. After loggers extract wood, speculators
        burn the remaining
        vegetation to clear it in hopes of selling the land to farmers and ranchers or simply invade it with no rights.
        In
        mid-August of this year, 68 fires were registered in indigenous territories and conservation areas, the majority
        in the
        Amazon. Further, the humid forests of the Amazon have no adaptation to fire and suffer immense damage. Almost
        all fires
        in humid forests are started by people.

      </p>




      <div class="toggle-content3">

        <p>Tropical rainforests comprise only 7% of the Earth's land surface, yet they support more than 60% of all
          known plant and
          animal species. Worldwide, tropical rainforests are facing many anthropogenic threats, such as pollution,
          climate
          change, and deforestation. The Amazon rainforest is the most extensive equatorial forest in the world and
          represents the
          largest reservoir of plant and animal species, hosting an estimated one-quarter of all terrestrial species. It
          is home
          of many tribal communities and incontestably, it is their lands. The Amazon rainforest is under rampant threat
          from
          widespread illegal and immoral deforestation, primarily for unsustainable agriculture.
        </p>

        <p>
          ESI has been involving local people and indigenous people as conservation stewards, conservationists, and
          informed
          forest users to protect and restore rainforest. Our rainforest projects are created and deeply rooted on the
          ground
          where ESI and local communities have already planted almost 1 million tropical tree seedlings and protected
          uncountable
          immense areas of native tropical forest.
