      <p class="p-headline">
        Endangered Species International is strongly committed to reversing the trend of human-induced species
        extinction,
        saving endangered animals, and preserving wild places.

      </p>
      <!-- <p>
        Biodiversity is the variety of life (its ecosystems, populations, species and genes). Saving endangered species
        (plants
        and animals) from becoming extinct and protecting their wild places is crucial for our health and the future of
        our
        children.
      </p> -->


      <p>Why protect biodiversity and save endangered species?
        As species are lost so too are our options for future discovery and advancement. The impacts of biodiversity
        loss
        include clearly into fewer new medicines, greater vulnerability to natural disasters and greater effects from
        global
        warming.
      </p>




      <p class="highlight-home">Every year we lose an area equal to the size of England of tropical forests</p>

      <p>Plants and animals are part of our unique heritage, they keep us alive, purifying water, fixing nitrogen,
        recycling
        nutrients and waste, and pollinating crops. They are vital for the physical and spiritual well-being offering us
        a
        colorful and rich world.</p>
