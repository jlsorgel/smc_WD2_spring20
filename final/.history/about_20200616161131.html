    <p class="p-headline">
      More than 31,000 species are threatened with extinction. That is 27% of all assessed species.
    </p>

    <p>We focus on species that have the biggest chance to become extinct including those that do not attract the
      media
      attention. Their ecosystems as a whole are a crucial component of our conservation strategy. We also work hard
      on
      saving
      endangered species found in various types of habitat and serving as protecting umbrella to other endangered
      species.
    </p>

    <p><b>We are a unique team of local and international scientists and conservation leaders</b></p>

    <p>Our staff is interdisciplinary ranging from endangered species experts, scientists, conservation awareness and
      communication leaders. Our staff has a strong local and international experience. We favour the emergence of
      young
      endangered species and conservation leaders around the world and integrate them in our projects.
    </p>

    <p></p>








    <p>Ninety eight (98) percent of our budget goes to our program activities on the ground to save endangered species
      and wild
      places. Less than 2 percent of our budget is allocated to administrative and fundraising purposes.
    </p>

    <p>We are ranked amongst the most efficient and trusted conservation organizations. ESI belongs to the Earth Angel
      List, a
      short list of efficient environmental organizations compiled by Prince Albert II of Monaco</p>

    <p>We have won a Top-Rated Award from GreatNonprofits from 2012 to now.</p>
    <p>We have reached the Platinum participation level (highest level) through the GuideStar Exchange. This is a
      strong
      testament to our organizationâ€™s commitment to transparency and hard work.</p>
