        <p> My name is Robert Kerr. I am the owner/operator of both Fritto Misto Neighborhood Italian Cafes. When I grew
          up in Napa
          in the 1960’s, it was a small, unpretentious, mainly agricultural town, where just about everyone knew just
          about
          everyone else. When my family went out for dinner we were welcomed by name and treated graciously, with
          affection and
          humor. They knew our favorite table, what we liked to eat, and my father’s favorite wine. We were warmly
          thanked upon
          leaving and invited to come back. The food was good, the portions large, and the prices low enough that our
          family of
          seven could actually afford to go out regularly.</p>

        <p>​When I moved to L.A. to attend the Restaurant Management program at Cal Poly, I found that things were often
          very
          different when I went out to eat here. The attitude too often was they made me feel like they thought they
          were doing ME
          a favor by letting me dine in their establishment. The food was very good but the portions way too small. It
          was
          unreasonably expensive. The service was often indifferent. I kept hearing from wait-staff that they were “not
          really a
          waiter, I’m an actor/model/writer”, etc. I was not made to feel particularly welcomed and valued. No one knew
          who I was
          and they didn’t seem interested in finding out.
        </p>

      <div class="about-textbox about-textbox-3  ">
        <p>​Fritto Misto was founded on the principles that everyone needs recognition, that everyone deserves to be
          valued as an
          individual and made to feel welcome, that everyone appreciates high quality at reasonable prices, and that no
          one wants
          to leave a restaurant feeling hungry after eating “nouveau” portions. We also believe that Italian food is
          best when
          served with wine, and that you shouldn’t have to pay $50 for a bottle of wine that you can buy at Vons’s for
          $15.

        <p>Fritto Misto is owner operated. The general manager, Melinda Amaya, has been with us since 1993. Her husband
          Franco has
          been the Santa Monica kitchen Manager since 1992. Jesus, the Hermosa Beach kitchen manager, has been with us
          since 1995.
          As of 2012, our other cooks have been with us an average of 14 years. Our front house managers have been here
          since 2001
          (Gaby), 2003 (Damien), and 2006 (Jonas). All of our manager’s enjoy profit sharing and engage equally in the
          decision
          making process. When we hire front-house staff, we don’t hire people who can act like they care. We hire
          people who
          ACTUALLY care. We hire people who plan on sticking around awhile, not just until the next audition comes
          along.
